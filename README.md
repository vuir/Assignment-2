# Hayat Alghamdi – Computer Science Portfolio (Assignment 2)

This project is an enhanced version of the Assignment 1 portfolio. It demonstrates the integration of **dynamic content**, **data handling**, **animations**, and **AI-assisted development** using core web technologies: **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

---

## Project Description

This updated portfolio website continues to serve as a digital résumé and interactive showcase of technical skills, projects, and personal details.  
The main focus of Assignment 2 was to expand the project with **JavaScript-based interactivity** and **data persistence** while improving layout consistency and user experience.

### New Features Added

- **Personalized Greeting Bar** – A dynamic banner that greets the visitor by name (e.g., *“Welcome, " "! Learn more about me on LinkedIn 💼”*).  
  - Allows users to save their name using **LocalStorage**.  
  - Includes Save, Edit, and Clear options.  
  - Automatically fades away when scrolling down from the home section.  
- **LinkedIn Integration** – Provides a direct link to connect via LinkedIn in the greeting bar.  
- **Scroll Animations** – Smooth fade-in effects on skills, projects, and greeting components for modern visual appeal.  
- **Responsive About Me Section** – Redesigned to match the size and layout of other sections, with a vertically centered paragraph for balanced composition.  
- **Accessible Form Handling** – Client-side form validation, visual feedback for success/failure, and improved keyboard accessibility.

These improvements align with Assignment 2’s requirements for **Dynamic Content**, **Data Handling**, **Animations**, and **Error Handling**.

## AI Usage Summary

This project incorporates **AI-assisted development** to improve structure, responsiveness, and interactivity.

### Key AI Contributions
- **Feature Implementation**: Helped design and implement the personalized greeting bar with LocalStorage functionality and smooth fade effects.  
- **Responsive Layout**: Guided alignment fixes for the About Me section and ensured equal section height across all devices.  
- **Animation System**: Generated ideas and sample code for Intersection Observer-based animations and transitions.  
- **Accessibility Improvements**: Suggested ARIA attributes and focus-visible styles for keyboard navigation.  
- **Documentation Support**: Assisted in drafting this README and refining the AI Usage Report.

### Responsible AI Practices
All AI-generated code and suggestions were:
- Reviewed, understood, and manually edited before integration.  
- Tested for correctness, responsiveness, and browser compatibility.  
- Documented transparently according to academic integrity standards.
