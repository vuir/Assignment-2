# AI Usage Report: Portfolio Website Enhancement (Assignment 2)

## Project Overview

This report explains how **AI tools** were used to enhance the portfolio website developed by *Hayat Alghamdi* for **Assignment 2**.  
The project builds upon Assignment 1, introducing **dynamic content**, **data handling**, and **animations** using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** with the support of **ChatGPT** and **Cursor AI**.

The goal was to create a more interactive, responsive, and user-friendly portfolio while demonstrating responsible use of AI-assisted development.

## Tools Used & Use Cases

### ChatGPT (OpenAI)
- Helped design and implement the **Personalized Greeting Bar** with LocalStorage.  
- Suggested logic for smooth fade effects and scroll-based visibility.  
- Provided layout improvements for the **About Me** section and responsive alignment.  
- Assisted in writing documentation (README and this report).

### Cursor AI
- Offered real-time suggestions and syntax improvements.  
- Assisted with **animation timing**, **fade transitions**, and **JavaScript event handling**.  
- Recommended accessibility fixes such as focus outlines and reduced motion handling.

## Key AI Contributions

1. **Dynamic Greeting Feature**  
   - Created a banner that saves the user’s name using **LocalStorage** and greets them with a LinkedIn link.  
   - Added fade-out behavior when scrolling away from the home section.

2. **Layout and Responsiveness**  
   - Improved **About Me** layout to center text and match section proportions.  
   - Enhanced responsive behavior for all screen sizes.

3. **Animations and Accessibility**  
   - Guided the setup of scroll-triggered fade animations with the Intersection Observer API.  
   - Suggested ARIA attributes and keyboard-focus improvements for accessibility.

## Benefits & Challenges

### Benefits
- Reduced development time through accurate code suggestions.  
- Improved understanding of JavaScript event-driven programming.  
- Strengthened responsive design and accessibility practices.

### Challenges
- Needed to adapt AI-generated code to match existing structure.  
- Required testing and debugging to ensure cross-browser consistency.

## Learning Outcomes

- Gained practical experience using **LocalStorage** for data persistence.  
- Enhanced skills in **DOM manipulation**, **responsive design**, and **animation logic**.  
- Learned to use AI tools critically as assistants, not replacements for problem-solving or creativity.

---

## Responsible AI Practices

- All AI-generated code was **reviewed, modified, and tested** manually.  
- AI usage was documented transparently and ethically.  
- No code was submitted without full understanding of its purpose and functionality.
